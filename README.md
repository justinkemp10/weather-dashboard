## Acceptance Criteria

1. As a traveler the user wants to see the weather outlook for multiple cities, so they can plan their trip accordingly.
2. When the user searches for the city, they are presented with the current and future weather conditions for that city.
3. When you view the current weather conditions for your searched city, then you are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.
4. When you view the UV Index then you are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
5. When the user views the future weather conditions then they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity.
6. If a user clicks on a city in the recent search history, then the user is again presented with the current and future weather conditions for that city.
